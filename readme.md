## Running

Install dependencies with bower and npm. You'll first need to have [bower](http://bower.io/) and [npm](npmjs.org) installed to do so. Then run the following:

```
bower install && npm install
```

This project comes with a grunt task to runs a [`connect`](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect) web server and opens up the web browser for you. Just run:

```
grunt
```
